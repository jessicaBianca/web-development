Welcome to my Web Development Study Repository! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

This repository is dedicated to learning and practicing web development.  
Here, I will store all my study materials, practice exercises, and personal learning projects.

## 📚 Purpose

The main goal of this repo is to:

- Practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Explore front-end and back-end frameworks
- Build mini projects for hands-on learning
- Track my progress as I learn web development
- Share my journey towards becoming a professional web developer


## 📌 Notes

This repository is **not intended for production** use.  
It is a personal space to grow, learn, and experiment with code.
